[Concordion](http://www.concordion.org) is an open source framework for Java that lets you turn a plain English description of a requirement into an automated test.

This project enables extra features in Concordion, such as embedding screenshots or logging information in the output.

The [demo project](https://github.com/concordion/concordion-extensions-demo) demonstrates the extensions using Concordion with Selenium WebDriver for end-to-end browser testing.

See the [documentation](http://concordion.org/ExtensionsLibrary.html) for more details.
